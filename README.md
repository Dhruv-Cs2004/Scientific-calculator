🌟 Key Strengths:

Your code already demonstrates several good practices and functional features. Here’s what stands out:

📋 Comprehensive Functionality:
Your calculator supports seven operations, including:

Addition ➕
Subtraction ➖
Multiplication ✖️
Division ➗
Average calculation 🔢
Modulus (remainder) calculation 🧮
Logarithmic calculations 📉
This variety ensures that users have access to both basic and advanced operations. 🌟

💡 User-Friendly Features:
Clear Instructions 📝: The program guides users step-by-step with prompts, making it easy for them to interact.
Exit Option 🔑: The "exit" feature is intuitive and allows users to terminate the program at any time without hassle.
Error Handling 🔄: By including try-catch blocks, your program gracefully handles invalid inputs, preventing crashes.
🎯 Modular Design:
The use of separate methods for each operation (e.g., AddNumber, Subtraction) ensures clean code and better maintainability. ✨ You’re following the single-responsibility principle, which is a hallmark of professional programming! 💼

🔍 Input Validation:
The program prevents invalid inputs from disrupting execution by using:

Number parsing checks 🛡️
Clear messages to the user when they enter something incorrect ❌
This level of robustness ensures a smooth user experience. 🙌

🔧 Suggestions for Improvement (with Details & Emojis!)

While your program works well, there’s always room for polishing and enhancements! Here’s how you can take it to the next level:

1. Fix Typos & Grammar (🖋️):
Words like "Strat" (should be Start) and "plz" (should be please) can make the program feel unpolished. Correcting these improves professionalism.
2. Optimize the Use of Scanner (📦):
Instead of creating a new Scanner instance in every method, declare a single global Scanner and reuse it across methods. This reduces memory overhead and keeps the code cleaner.
3. Add Input Validations (🔍):
Enhance the user experience with these checks:

Division (➗): Ensure the divisor is not zero (e.g., if (divisor == 0)).
Logarithm (📉): Restrict invalid base values like <= 0 or == 1. Provide meaningful feedback if such values are entered.
4. Improve Console Output (🖥️):
Add line separators (e.g., System.out.println("----------");) to make outputs more readable.
Format results with descriptive text like "The result of your addition is: ..." instead of just the value.
🚀 Advanced Enhancements (Optional but Cool!):

1. Add History Feature (📜):
Keep a record of all calculations performed during the session. At the end, provide users with an option to view the history.
2. Add More Scientific Operations (📊):
Introduce advanced math features like:

Square root √
Exponentiation (^ or Math.pow)
Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
3. Include Edge Case Handling (⚠️):
Handle special cases like:

Empty input for average calculations 🔢
Unexpected symbols in modulus and other operations.
4. Exit Confirmation (🔒):
Before terminating the program, ask the user:
"Are you sure you want to exit? (yes/no)"

5. Build a Graphical Interface (🖌️):
Transform the program into a GUI-based calculator using Java Swing or JavaFX for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
